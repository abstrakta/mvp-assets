# bundle-3

## Introduction

This bundle consists of 5 climatological datasets extracted from the Climate Model Inter-comparison Project 6 (CMIP6) archive.  The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, which began in 1995 under the auspices of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), is now in its sixth phase (CMIP6). CMIP6 coordinates somewhat independent model intercomparison activities and their experiments which have adopted a common infrastructure for collecting, organizing, and distributing output from models performing common sets of experiments. The simulation data produced by models under previous phases of CMIP have been used in thousands of research papers (some of which are listed here), and the multi-model results provide some perspective on errors and uncertainty in model simulations. This information has proved invaluable in preparing high profile reports assessing our understanding of climate and climate change (e.g., the IPCC Assessment Reports).

## Bundle Overview

The bundle consists of five datasets downloaded from the CMIP6 archive - see https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6.  The total CMIP6 archive size is several hundres petabytes, thus the example files represent a tiny fraction of the archive as a whole.

Each file within the bundle obeys a [Directory Naming Syntax](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/2722/) (DRS) defined by the WCRP:

`{variable}_{frequency}-{source-id}-{experiment-id}-{variant}-{grid}-{time-period}.nc`
